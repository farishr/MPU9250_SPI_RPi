# mpu-spi-lib
This python package interfaces the MPU9250 (9-Axis (Gyro + Accelerometer + Compass) MEMS MotionTracking Device) with the Raspberry Pi using SPI interface. Package includes functions for data extraction from sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Temperature), calibration, range setting for sensors and inbuilt Low Pass Filters. This repository will be updated constantly with moer functions, better functionalities, test results etc. This is an experimental and learning project for me.
